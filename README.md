# BackupManager
 A small utility to assist with managing backup files offline
# What is all this about?
 I'm sure I dont have to explain the importance of having a good backup system in place, especially if you run any type of business or website. Not only is it important to consistantly back your files up, but it is just as important to ensure your backup files are stored seperately and offline to your main server files, in the event of a total disaster or corruption, you will still have access to these backups. This utility was created to assist website owners with a free solution to automatically scan a backup folder (or any FTP folder) and syncronise files with a local folder, making it easy to ensure your backups are always kept offline. If the email settings are configured the user will also receive an email report.
# But heaps of these already exist, why did you write this?
* I wrote this to help a friend with a small, simple utility to keep his backups offline.
* To practice .NET Core dependency injection, whilst its easy to use the ASP.NET templates which already have DI setup, I wrote this to learn more about it and set it up from scratch (as it is a console application).
* Because I can ;)
